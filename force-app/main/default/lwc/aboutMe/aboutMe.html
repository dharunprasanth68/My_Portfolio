            <p>With over 3+ years of experience, I've had the chance to dive into customizing Apex codes, building sleek Lightning Web Components, and crafting seamless flows and integration. While I can't promise Salesforce has a hidden "magic" button, I’ve definitely learned a trick or two to make things run smoother and more efficiently!</p>
            <br>  
            <p>I recently earned my Master’s degree in Information Technology, and yes, I survived grad school with a GPA of 4.00 (but hey, let’s stay humble). When I’m not writing crisp SOQL queries or connecting systems like puzzle pieces, I’m likely behind a camera, capturing street scenes, travel moments, or nature’s calm beauty—trees don’t move, but they sure make great subjects.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While I enjoy those deep coding sessions, I also thrive in collaborative environments! I’m the person who jumps into meetings ready to brainstorm (even on Mondays) and loves working with a team to build something truly impactful. Together, we’ll make things faster, smarter, and better for everyone involved—because let’s face it, teamwork really does make the dream work!</p>
