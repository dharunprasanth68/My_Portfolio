            <p>
                Hey there! I'm Dharun Prasanth Dhandapani, an enthusiastic Salesforce Developer and Administrator with over 3+ years of experience. Whether it's customizing Apex, building slick Lightning Components, or crafting seamless flows and triggers, I'm all about delivering top-notch, high-quality solutions that make users wonder if Salesforce has a "magic" button somewhere (spoiler: it doesn't, but close enough).

                I recently graduated with a Master’s degree in Information Technology—yes, I survived grad school with a GPA of 4.00, but let's not brag. Outside of writing perfect SOQL queries and integrating systems like a data magician, my side hustle involves pointing a camera at anything that moves—or doesn't, like nature (hello, trees). I'm into street, travel, and nature photography, because who wouldn't want to be behind the lens while experiencing the beauty of the world?

                As much as I love my solo coding marathons, I thrive on teamwork too! I’m that guy who jumps into meetings with a smile (yes, even on Mondays) and loves collaborating with teams to build something epic. Together, we’ll make the system faster, smarter, and better for everyone involved—because teamwork really does make the dream work!
